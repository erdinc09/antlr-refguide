# antlr-refguide

This is the code associated with the book [The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference](https://pragprog.com/book/tpantlr2/the-definitive-antlr-4-reference) by Terence Parr, published by [The Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com).

I've applied the updates of lukekras from [def-antlr4-ref-code](https://github.com/lukekras/def-antlr4-ref-code).

I've simply read the book, downloaded the code, and run the examples (using Antlr 4.9.2). This repo is the result of the corrections to the code for the above versions of antler.

This repo is mavenized project of the code.

## build

Just `mvn compile` in root (`antlr-refguide` directory, containing pom file) directory.
